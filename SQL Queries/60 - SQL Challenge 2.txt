/*
SQL CHALLENGE

Iâ€™d like you to create a view called vw_outliers in the course_project 
catalog of the citibike schema. The view should contains only records where the trip 
duration is less than 0 or greater than 2000 minutes, along with the ride id and 
start and end station ids.

Use the jc_bike_data_22 table.
*/

create view course_project.citibike.vw_outliers as
select
ride_id,
start_station_id,
end_station_id,
datediff(minute, started_at, ended_at) as trip_duration_mins
from course_project.citibike.jc_bike_data_22
where datediff(minute, started_at, ended_at) <0
or datediff(minute, started_at, ended_at) >2000;
