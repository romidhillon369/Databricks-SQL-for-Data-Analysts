SQL CHALLENGE

Iâ€™d like you to return results showing the number of total rides for short, medium
and long duration journeys.

A short journey lasts under 10 minutes
A medium journey lasts between 10 - 60 minutes (inclusive)
A long journey is over 60 minutes

Use the jc_bike_data_22 dataset

Use subqueries

  when trip_duration_mins <=60 then 'Medium'
  else 'Long'
