/*
SQL CHALLENGE

Iâ€™d like you to return a query that shows the most popular combination of start 
and end stations in terms of the total number of journeys across the dataset.

The start and end stations should be in the format:
'start_station_name TO end_station_name'
e.g. 'Van Vorst Park TO Jersey & 3rd'

Use the jc_bike_data_22 and station_data tables.

Hint 1: Consider using the concat function and join operations
Hint 2: Consider using subqueries
*/

select
count(ride_id) as total_rides,
concat(start_station, ' TO ', end_station) as start_end_station
from
(select 
t1.ride_id,
t2.station_name as start_station,
t3.station_name as end_station
from jc_bike_data_22 as t1
left join station_data as t2
on t1.start_station_id = t2.station_id
left join station_data as t3
on t1.end_station_id = t3.station_id)
group by concat(start_station, ' TO ', end_station)
order by total_rides desc;
