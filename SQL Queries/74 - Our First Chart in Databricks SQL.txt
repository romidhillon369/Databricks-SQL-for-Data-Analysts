/*
Dimensions:Â contain qualitative values (such as names, dates, or geographical data). 
You can use dimensions to categorize, segment, and reveal the details in your data. 

Measures: contain numeric, quantitative values that you can measure. 
Measures can be aggregated in a visualization.

Bar Chart: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/visualizations/visualization-types#bar-chart

The bar chart is suitable for comparing multiple values. 
The dimension axis shows the category items that are compared, 
and the measure axis shows the value for each category item.
The bar chart is also useful when you want to compare values 
side by side.

Advantages: The bar chart is easy to read and understand. 
You get a good overview of values when using bar charts.

Disadvantages: The bar chart does not work so well with many dimension values due to the limitation of the axis length. 
If the dimensions do not fit, you can scroll using the scroll bar, but then you might not get the full picture.
